name: Deploy Notification To phoenix-desktop repo to update its build src from this tauri branch
# Aim: Update 'phoenix-desktop' repository with new 'tauri' branch build source.
# Process:
# 1. The 'tauri' repository, branch, and commit information are stored in the 'package.json' file in the 'phoenix-desktop' repository.
# 2. We initiate an action that instructs the 'phoenix-desktop' repository to update its commit ID.
# 3. Then, a pull request is created to merge the new version.
# 4. The purpose of these steps is to ensure build consistency.
