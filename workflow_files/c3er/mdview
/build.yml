# Currently, the action can only work with Linux. Both, macOS and Windows fail, due to some hard to
# isolate problems.
# On Windows, it gets interrupted somehow; sometimes showing that a ^C signal came, sometimes via a
# SIGINT. GitHub Runner issue #2468 (https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/2468) seems related to
# this.
# On macOS, it fails reproducable at copying the custom application icon file with an EEXIST error.
# That seems to be electron-builder issue #6570
