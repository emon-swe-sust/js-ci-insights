# It is triggered on created pull_requests with changes in the "generated_locales" folder. It will apply the locale files from the "generated_locales" folder and commit the changes to the repository.

# GitHub repo configuration:
# 1. Go to Manage access and add 'Github Actions' team with role: admin.
# 2. If you have protected branches, go to Branches > edit protected branch > enable 'Restrict who can push to
#    matching branches' and add the 'athombv/github-actions' team.

# Note: make sure to commit package-lock.json, this is needed for `npm ci`.
